ORB / AUG – END GOAL DESCRIPTION (EXPANDED AND CORRECT)

Orb (AUG) is a local, personal AGI-grade operating system that acts as an extension of my mind.
It is not one AI. It is the orchestrator of many AIs, tools, sensors, and interfaces.
Its purpose is to become my digital nervous system, operating across every domain of my work and life.

Orb’s end-goal is to:
Understand what I’m doing, on-screen and off-screen.
Remember the context of my world: projects, tasks, health, media, finances, study, habits.
Take actions on my behalf when requested.
Guide me when I’m stuck, learning something new, or making decisions.
Interact with me via voice, screen overlay, mouse control, and multimodal perception.
Eventually behave like personal AGI, bound by strict security, local compute, and my explicit rules.
Below is the expanded end-goal in structured form.

1. Universal Life Integration (Everything I Do)
Orb’s long-term functionality spans:
Work & Projects
Software development (routing, architecture, coding, debugging).
Writing, planning, documentation, spreadsheets, admin.
Project memory + cross-project intelligence.
Fitness & Health
Nutrition logging, macro tracking, ketosis monitoring.
Physiology understanding (HR spikes, fatigue).
Workout planning based on workload, surfing schedule, injuries.
Long-term progress tracking with visual + textual memory.
Leisure & Personal Life
Music analysis (Ableton workflows, basslines, arrangements).
Surf forecasting (wind, swell, tide, wave period).
Weather predictions relevant to daily planning.
Netflix and streaming control (voice-driven).
Media recommendations based on long-term taste patterns.
Finance & Accounting
Personal finance automation.
Income tracking for delivery work.
Spreadsheet generation, invoicing, forecasting.
Business finances for future app ecosystem.
Dietary & Lifestyle Optimisation
Meal planning compatible with keto/low-carb.
Warnings about foods breaking ketosis.
Suggestions tailored to fatigue, workload, gym/surf days.
Education & Study (March onwards)
OCR of textbooks, PDFs, lecture notes.
Realtime explanation of anything I highlight on-screen.
Study partner that tracks concepts, revisits weak points.
“Look over my shoulder” mode to help while using new software.
Orb’s mission is to unify every domain into one continuous memory system.

2. Screen Understanding, Cursor Awareness, and Real-Time Assistance
Orb will support:
Full-screen OCR
It can read anything on my screen instantly: PDFs, IDEs, textbooks, instructions, diagrams.
Cursor awareness
It knows what I’m pointing at, what’s selected, what window I’m in.
Contextual support
If I say “What’s this?” it knows what the “this” refers to.
Guided learning
When I open new software (Photoshop, Ableton, VS Code, Excel, etc.), Orb guides me:
What the tools do.
Where to click.
Why something isn’t working.
This is the “look over my shoulder” mode.

3. Action Capability and Control
Orb must evolve from passive assistant to active operator when requested.
Take control of the mouse (when permitted).
Open applications.
Search online.
Navigate Netflix, YouTube, and websites.
Play music or video content.
Automate repetitive workflows (renaming, sorting, downloading, converting).
Critical rule:
No actions without explicit permission.
This is how Orb becomes useful but stays controlled.

4. Long-Term Memory and Personal Model of Me
Orb must maintain:
A life-long memory of my preferences.
My taste in music, films, workouts, learning style, coding architecture style.
The “state of my world”: open projects, deadlines, habits, things I’m building.
Memory must be:
Project-specific with no contamination.

Queryable.
Updateable through conversation.
Secure and encrypted.
Orb should be able to say:
“You usually prefer X when tired.”
“This fits your surf conditions preference.”
“You rejected a similar idea last month because of Y.”
This is the core of personal AGI.

5. Multimodal Mastery (Gemini Integration)
Orb must use different Gemini tiers appropriately:
Flash tier for cheap screenshot / OCR / simple image tasks.
Gemini 3.0 / 3 Pro for:
Long videos (reels, YouTube editing suggestions).
Scene breakdowns, timestamps, content planning.
Critiquing Claude Opus’s architecture and code.
Orb should become a full multimedia strategist:
Suggest edits.
Identify best clips.
Recommend thumbnails.
Create content structures.

6. Voice, Streaming, and Presence
Orb must eventually have a persistent “presence”:
Always-on wake word (“Solace” or “Orb”).
Soft, well-spoken British female voice (your preference).
Real-time streaming TTS (not turn-based).
Ability to interrupt, ask questions, clarify.
When I say:
“Hey Orb, what’s this?”
Orb immediately responds with awareness of the exact context on my screen.

7. Security & Local Control
Non-negotiable guarantees:
No plaintext secrets ever stored.
Encryption using master key in Windows Credential Manager.
Local-first design: my data lives on my machine, not the cloud.
Explicit control for any action beyond reading.
Logged and auditable behaviour.
Orb must be “trusted infrastructure”, not a toy.

8. The True Mission of Orb / AUG
Orb is being built to become:
My personal AGI that integrates every aspect of my work, health, learning, creativity, finances, and media life.
It thinks with me, watches with me, learns me, guides me, and acts when I ask it.
It is my digital nervous system.
Orb is not meant to impress the world — it is meant to run your world.
