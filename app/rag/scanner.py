"""
Filesystem scanner for RAG indexing.

DEPRECATED APPROACH: This module was designed for filesystem scanning,
but RAG now reads FROM architecture_file_content table instead.

See: WP-2.1 for revised implementation (reads from DB, not filesystem)

# Placeholder for Phase 2.1
# Will contain:
# - ScannedFile dataclass
# - FilesystemScanner class (reads from architecture scan DB)
