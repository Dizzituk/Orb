      "description": "The architecture is critically incomplete. It describes high-level components like 'Game Logic', 'Rendering', 'Input Handling', and a 'Game Loop' but provides no design or implementation details for the latter three. The document only contains data structures and pure utility functions, which is insufficient to define a functional system.",
      "fix_suggestion": "Provide a detailed design for the main `Game` class or state machine that orchestrates the system. Define the structure of the game loop, how input events from the keyboard will be handled and translated into game actions, and the strategy for rendering the game state to the HTML5 Canvas."

      "description": "The `getRandomTetrominoType` function uses a naive `Math.random()` approach. This can lead to long sequences of the same piece or long droughts of a required piece, which is generally considered poor game design for Tetris.",
      "fix_suggestion": "Implement a 'Random Bag' (or '7-Bag') system. This algorithm ensures that all seven tetromino types appear exactly once in a randomized sequence before the sequence is repeated, providing a more balanced and fair piece distribution."

      "severity": "non_blocking",
      "description": "The `rotateTetromino` function performs a pure matrix rotation and does not account for 'wall kicks' or 'floor kicks'. This means a piece adjacent to a wall or another block will be un-rotatable, even if a valid position exists one block over, which contradicts modern Tetris standards (e.g., Super Rotation System).",
      "fix_suggestion": "Modify the game logic that calls `rotateTetromino`. After an initial rotation attempt results in a collision, the system should test a series of predefined offset positions (kicks) to find a valid placement for the rotated piece. The Tetris Guideline specifies standard kick tables for this purpose."

      "description": "The `GameState` interface is monolithic. While acceptable for a simple implementation, this can become difficult to manage, especially if features like replays, state serialization, or advanced state-dependent rendering are added.",
      "fix_suggestion": "Consider decomposing the game state. For example, `playerState` (score, level, lines), `boardState` (the grid), and `pieceState` (current/next piece) could be separated to better organize the logic that modifies each part of the state."

  "summary": "The document provides a reasonable foundation for the data structures and utility functions of a Tetris game but fails as an architecture document. It is critically incomplete, lacking any design for the main application loop, rendering, or input handling. Furthermore, a core logic function is syntactically broken. The design must be completed and the code fixed before this can be approved.",
