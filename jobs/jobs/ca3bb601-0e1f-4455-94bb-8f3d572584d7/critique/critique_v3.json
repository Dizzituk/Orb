      "description": "The architecture document is critically incomplete. Key components such as the main 'Game' class, the 'Renderer' class, the Input Handling system, and the Game Loop are mentioned but are not designed or specified in any detail. The provided code only consists of data types and utility functions, not a functional architecture.",
      "fix_suggestion": "Provide detailed designs, class diagrams, or code skeletons for the `Game` class (state management), `Renderer` class (drawing to the canvas), `InputHandler` (event listeners and action mapping), and the main `GameLoop` function."

      "description": "The architecture completely fails to address the specified ENVIRONMENT_CONSTRAINTS. It describes a generic web application with no consideration for the required single-host Windows deployment, local security controls, file-based logging, or packaging.",
      "fix_suggestion": "Add a new 'Deployment and Operations' section that details how the application will be packaged (e.g., as an Electron app), installed, and run on a single Windows 11 host. This section must address how it will adhere to the constraints, such as using the local file system for audit logs and integrating with Windows security features."

      "description": "The piece generator uses a simple `Math.random()` on the list of tetromino types. This can result in an unfair piece distribution (e.g., long droughts of a needed piece). Modern Tetris implementations typically use a '7-bag' randomizer system.",
      "fix_suggestion": "Implement a '7-bag' randomizer. This involves creating a shuffled list of all seven tetromino types, dealing them out one by one, and then creating a new shuffled bag once the first one is empty."

      "description": "The `rotateTetromino` function implements a naive matrix rotation. This will cause rotations to fail when near walls or other pieces, which is not standard for modern Tetris. The architecture lacks a 'wall kick' system (like SRS) to allow pieces to shift slightly to complete a rotation.",
      "fix_suggestion": "Implement a wall kick system. This typically involves defining a set of offset checks to try if the initial rotation results in a collision. Refer to the Super Rotation System (SRS) specification for standard wall kick data."

  "summary": "The architecture is critically incomplete and cannot be approved. While it provides a reasonable starting point for data structures, it completely omits the design of core components like the game loop, rendering engine, and state management. Furthermore, the provided code for collision detection is truncated, and the entire document fails to address the mandatory deployment and operational constraints. The design requires significant additions to be considered a viable architecture.",
