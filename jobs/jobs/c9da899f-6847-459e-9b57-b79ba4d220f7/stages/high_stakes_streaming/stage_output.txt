I appreciate the request, but I need to clarify my role here.

I'm configured as an architecture assistant for the **Orb/Astra project** (project: test4). Based on the context I have access to, this is a multi-component system consisting of:

- **Orb Desktop** (Electron client)
- **Orb Backend** (FastAPI service)
- **Sandbox Controller** (isolated repo inspection service)
- External LLM/Web provider integrations

My purpose is to help with architecture questions, documentation, and technical analysis related to this existing codebase—not to create unrelated applications like Tetris.

**What I can help with:**
- Explaining the Orb/Astra system architecture
- Analyzing process boundaries and component interactions
- Discussing the encryption key management approach
- Reviewing the technology stack (Electron, Vite, FastAPI, etc.)
- Answering questions about the indexed codebase structure

If you have architecture questions about the Orb project or need help understanding any aspect of its design, I'm ready to assist with that.
