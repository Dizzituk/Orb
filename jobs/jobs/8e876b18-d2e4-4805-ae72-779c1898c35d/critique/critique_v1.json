      "description": "The implied architecture tightly couples presentation (HTML), styling (CSS), and all game logic (JavaScript) into a single file and a global scope. This monolithic approach reduces modularity, making the codebase difficult to test, maintain, and extend.",
      "fix_suggestion": "Propose a modular design that separates concerns. Define distinct modules or classes for the Game Board state, Rendering Engine, and Input Handler. This will create a cleaner, more maintainable structure."
