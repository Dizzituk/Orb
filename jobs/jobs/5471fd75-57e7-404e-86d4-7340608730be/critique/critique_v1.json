      "description": "The scoring mechanism defined for clearing lines (100/300/500/800 for 1/2/3/4 lines) does not follow the standard Tetris scoring guidelines mentioned in the specification's constraints. Official scoring systems typically incorporate the current level to scale the points awarded (e.g., `score = base_points * (level + 1)`).",
      "fix_suggestion": "Update the scoring logic in the 'CheckLines' action to use a standard level-dependent formula. For example, use base points of 40/100/300/1200 for 1/2/3/4 lines respectively, and multiply the result by `(level + 1)`."

      "description": "Collision detection is a core game mechanic that is only implied in various action descriptions (e.g., 'if not blocked', 'if valid'). The architecture lacks an explicit definition of how piece movements and rotations are validated against the game board boundaries and existing locked pieces.",
      "fix_suggestion": "Define a dedicated utility function or service, such as 'isPositionValid(piece, board)', that can be explicitly called by actions like 'MovePieceLeft', 'RotatePiece', and 'CheckGameOver'. This will centralize the collision logic and improve the clarity of the design."

      "description": "The 'SaveHighScore' action and 'highScore' state mention persistence to storage, but the specific storage mechanism is not defined. This leaves a key implementation detail ambiguous.",

  "summary": "The architecture presents a solid event-driven design for the game of Tetris, covering the essential UI screens, state, and actions. However, it is blocked by a critical correctness issue in the scoring logic, which deviates from the specified guidelines. The design would also be improved by explicitly defining core mechanics like collision detection and the high-score persistence method.",
